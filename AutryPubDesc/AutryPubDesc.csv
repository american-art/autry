87.46.1,"Painting by Frederic Remington, <em>An Incident in the Opening up of a Cattle Country</em>, 1887. Signed and dated in bottom right corner.

Published in <em>Century Illustrated Magazine</em>, 1888 and in <em>Ranch Life and the Hunting Trail</em> by Theodore Roosevelt, 1888.  This painting was one of five works the artist sent to the 1889 Paris Universal Exposition. The basic format on which later works such as <em>The Last Lull in the Fight</em> and <em>Caught in the Circle</em> would be based."
87.87.1,"Watercolor by A.C. Redwood, <em>Hanging of Netherington and Brace, 1856</em>, 1891."
87.87.7,"Watercolor by Vincent Colyer, <em>Chinamen's Quarters on the Central Pacific Rail Road</em>, October 1870.

88.108.2,"Painting by William Tylee Ranney, <em>The Trappers</em>, 1856. Signed bottom center."
88.108.3,"Painting by William Tylee Ranney, <em>Hunting Wild Horses</em>, 1846. Signed bottom left.

The wild horses of the West embodied the freedom of movement associated with life on the plains. At the same time, they were an economic resource. In 1846, one traveler described them as a “valuable article of export, as they are innumerable, and cost only the trouble of catching.”  William Tylee Ranney’s painting embodies this tension between the notion of a wild West and one that has been tamed."
88.108.4,"Painting by John Mix Stanley, <em>Snake in the Grass</em>, 1868. Signed bottom left corner."
88.108.7,"Painting by George Catlin, <em>Buffalo Hunting</em>, 1863.  
Signed bottom right."
88.108.9,"Painting by Albert Bierstadt, <em>Mountain Lake</em>, undated. 
Signed bottom left with red ink.
This painting does not represent an actual place but is rather a composite of grand scenery assembled from various landscapes in the Intermountain West. As the West began to open to tourism following the Civil War, public taste for exaggerated landscape spectacles started to wane and Bierstadt’s reputation began a slow decline."
88.108.10,"Painting by John Mix Stanley, <em>Young Chief Uncas</em>, circa 1870. Signed toward right edge of bottom center line.
Chief Uncas is a character from James Fenimore Cooper's 1826 novel, <em>Last of the Mohicans</em>. Based on a seventeenth-century Monhegan chief who allied with the English during the Pequot War of 1637, Uncas became a romantic symbol of all that was noble about Native America."

88.108.13,"Painting by Albert Bierstadt, <em>Landscape with Indians</em>, 1859.

88.108.23,"Painting by Karl Bodmer, <em>Snags on the Missouri<</em>, circa 1833. Signed bottom right."
88.108.26,"Drawing by Frederic Remington, <em>Leaving the Canyon (10<sup>th</sup> Cavalry soldiers with wounded Apache)</em>, 1887. Signed bottom right.

Among Frederick Remington’s early illustrations of the West are multiple images of men who served in the 9<sup>th</sup> and 10<sup>th</sup> Cavalry. Sent to cover the government’s campaign against the Apache in the Southwest, Remington spent several weeks with the 10<sup>th</sup> Cavalry in 1886 and 1888. His sympathetic essays, illustrations, and paintings helped popularize the name and exploits of the Buffalo Soldiers."
88.108.27,"Painting by Seth Eastman, <em>Indian on the Lookout</em>, undated.

Known as the “soldier-artist of the frontier,” Seth Eastman composed on-location paintings as an attempt to preserve ordinary moments from Native American life. Like many of his artistic colleagues at mid-century, Eastman saw this as a world in decline; his art was thus part of a broader ethnographic impulse to document Native peoples before they succumbed to the corruptive influence of European society. 

In <em>Indian on the Lookout</em>, Eastman uses a decaying tree as a metaphor for the deterioration of Native America. His military training gave him a keen command of topographical detail, and he often painted river views with imposed Indian figures. The figure is an accurate if somewhat generic image of a Native man, but the landscape is an imagined combination of Western topography, from canyons and meadows to rivers and mountains."
88.108.30,"Painting by Newell Convers Wyeth, <em>Western Characters on Horseback</em>, acquired by the Museum 1988. Signed bottom right."
88.108.31,"Painting by Newell Convers Wyeth, <em>An Indian War Party</em>, undated.
 Signed bottom right."
88.108.33,"Painting by John Mix Stanley, <em>Crossing the Milk River 1853</em>, after 1853.
 No signature.
Artist John Mix Stanley first visited the West in 1839.  In the 1850s, when Stanley painted the Milk River in Montana, it was still an important travel route for the fur trade.  In his day, critics celebrated his works as both accurate and beautiful."
88.108.47,"Sculpture by James Earle Fraser, <em>End of the Trail</em>, 1896. Cast by Roman Bronze Works, New York."
88.108.63,"Painting by Alfred Sully, <em>Yanckton Sioux Settlement</em>, 1853.
Depicts Yankton Sioux settlement near Fort Pierre, South Dakota. The arrival of horses created new social and trade relationships. Some groups like the Comanche, Lakota, and Cheyenne moved onto the Plains for the whole year, devoting themselves to the bison hunt. Others, such as the Mandan, Hidatsa, and Wichita continued to farm in the fertile river valleys of the Plains. By 1800, these settled villagers became middlemen in trade with Europeans. In their villages, guns and metal tools, blankets, and dried corn were exchanged for bison robes, meat, and horses."
88.368.1,"Painted leather carving by Bob Brown, depicting the gunfight at OK Corral, Tombstone, Arizona, 1978."
89.54.1,"Yankton Sioux bear claw necklace with large trade beads and decorated with red ochre and fur, mid-1800s. Previously owned by Wigkan, a Yankton leader, and given to John H. Waugh, Indian Agent, Ft. Totten, North Dakota (1883-1903) in 1891.

Made from the claws of the now extinct Plains grizzly bear, this necklace represented the owner's exceptional power as a hunter, warrior and leader. Men of high status wore such distinctive necklaces on occasions of state. Bear claw necklaces were especially popular among prairie tribes such as the Iowa, Missouri, Fox, Sauk, and Oto."
89.223.1,"Painting by Oscar Edmund Berninghaus, <em>Anheuser-Busch Pack Mules</em>, circa 1925.  
Possibly one panel from a mural at the Southern Cafe and Eatery, St. Louis, Missouri."

90.141.1,"Painting by William Robinson Leigh, <em>Leader of the Badlands Bunch</em>, 1913. Signed bottom left corner."
90.142.2,"Painting by Thomas Moran, <em>Green River</em>, 1912."
90.142.3,"Painting by Frank Tenney Johnson, <em>Changing Horses on the Pony Express</em>, 1927. 
Frank Tenney Johnson was considered America's premier western artist following the deaths of Frederic Remington in 1909 and Charles Russell in 1926. Johnson settled in California in 1925, where his circle of friends included artists and Hollywood personalities, from Will Rogers to artists Edward Borein and Maynard Dixon. Possibly influenced by Hollywood's adaptation of the mythic West in film, in California Johnson continued to create dramas based on cowboy life such as Changing Horses on the Pony Express. While viewed in its day as an accurate representation of the West, the painting is misleading: Johnson portrays working cowboy clothing and equipment from 1927, although the pony express had ceased to exist in 1861."
90.183.4.2,"Lithograph print by George Catlin, <em>Catlin the Celebrated Indian Traveller and Artist Firing His Colt's Repeating Rifle before a Tribe of Carib Indians in South America</em>, circa 1851. 
One of six lithographs commissioned by Samuel Colt."
90.209.1,"Bulto of San Francisco by Arroyo Hondo Carver, carved and painted wood, Arroyo Hondo, New Mexico, circa 1830-1845. 

The prominence of saints in Hispanic art stems from the devotional practices of Roman Catholicism, which were transmitted to colonial Mexico with the Spanish conquest. In the remote outpost of northern New Mexico, carved and painted figures of saints were called upon for help with rain, harvests, and other situations. 

The political isolation and increasing wealth of northern New Mexico made for a unique and flourishing tradition of devotional art. This piece is attributed to the Arroyo Hondo santero (a maker of santos) who worked in the rural communities around Taos. Characterized by a simple elegance, his work has been described as “the most purely spiritualized sculpture of nineteenth-century New Mexico.” The piece also reflects the prominence of the Franciscan Order, which advocated the ideals of piety and charity."
90.232.3,"Bulto by José Benito Ortega of Nuestra Señora de la Limpia Concepcion, circa 1910."
90.238.3,"Painting by Newell Convers Wyeth, <em>Bucking Bronco</em> 1903.
Cover illustration of the February 21, 1903 issue of the Saturday Evening Post."
90.242.1,"Bulto by Luis Tapia, <em>Tribute to Maria Benitez</em>, by Luis Tapia, 1990.

Bultos (saints carved in the round) have been a prominent art form in northern New Mexico since the eighteenth century, when geographic isolation prompted the faithful to create devotional figures for personal use. Tapia’s portrait of the legendary flamenco dancer Maria Benitez represents a contemporary manifestation of this historic art form while evoking the graceful movement of the flamenco dance, also an important ritual in Hispanic society."
90.243.1,"Painting by Stewart Robertson, <em>Portrait of Mrs. Buck Jones</em>, 1923.
Signed bottom left."
91.41.1,"Chair, hand carved,  in shape of buffalo head, real horns, mahogany and rosewood, Scotland, 1842.  This is the bigger of two similar, but not identical chairs. 
Sir William Drummond Stewart, the younger son of a Scottish lord, came to America in 1832. When Sir William returned to Scotland in 1839 from a tour of the American West, he brought back a few souvenirs, including exotic plants, several bison, three Indians, and his M&eacute;tis guide Antoine Clement.  He designed these remarkable chairs for the central hall of his Scottish estate, Murthly castle."
91.41.2,"Chair, hand carved, in shape of buffalo head, real horns, mahogany and rosewood, Scotland, 1842.  This is smaller of two similar, but not identical chairs.

Sir William Drummond Stewart, the younger son of a Scottish lord, came to America in 1832.  When Sir William returned to Scotland in 1839 from a tour of the American West, he brought back a few souvenirs, including exotic plants, several bison, three Indians, and his Métis guide Antoine Clement.  He designed these remarkable chairs for the central hall of his Scottish estate, Murthly castle."
91.42.1,"Hmong story quilt, made by See Lee, cotton cloth with embroidered design, circa 1980.  
Depicts daily life of Hmong in Laos, war and flight from Laos to refugee camps in Thailand, and their subsequent move to the United States."
91.145.1,"Processional cross by Jimmy E. Trujillo, 1991. Signature on back of cross and base.
Straw inlay is a traditional technique in Spanish Colonial art, in which dried straw or cornhusks are affixed to the surface of the wood to create a pattern."
91.176.1,"Altar screen made by Luis Tapia, wood with tin and plastic decorations, painted with acrylic paints, 1990. 
Inscribed at base: <em>Dedisco este altar a la memoria de mi Amigo Chris Corriz 1974/1990</em> and <em>Este altar fue hecho por la mano de Luis T 1990</em>."
91.183.1,"Painting by Amedee Joulin, <em>Yeong Wo Joss House</em>, circa 1880s. 
This painting was probably shown at the California Midwinter Expo in 1894."
91.183.2,"Painting by Charles C. Nahl, <em>The Dead Miner</em>, 1867.

Charles Christian Nahl established a career based on his paintings of California’s mining industry. Miners were portrayed in fiction and popular culture as either moral men or dissolute louts, offering lessons on virtue and vice. By the time Nahl painted this picture, the gold rush had long subsided. His work coincided with a popular reimagining of this legendary era as a time that tested the wills of men. His painting <em>The Dead Miner</em> was designed to elicit maximum sympathy: depicted as a martyr to progress, the miner’s outstretched hand clasps a portrait of his sweetheart, and he has only his loyal hound to mourn him."
91.221.33,"Sculpture by Frederic Remington, <em>The Broncho Buster</em>, cast number 26, 1895.  

<em>The Broncho Buster</em>, the first and best-known sculpture by Frederic Remington, is recognized as an icon of American art. Based on the composition of an 1882 illustration for <em>Harper's Weekly</em> titled ""A Pitching Bronco,"" the preliminary clay sculpture was completed in 1895 and copyrighted in October of that year. 

The work, with horse and rider twisting upward through space in one fluid, serpentine movement, represents a break from the static formula used in most equine sculpture of Remington's day. An acknowledged metaphor for the taming of the West, the subject of a cowboy breaking an unruly horse was by far his most popular, suggested in the more than three hundred casts created during the artist's lifetime."
91.221.49,"Painting by Thomas Moran, <em>Mountain of the Holy Cross</em>, 1875.

Few sites embodied romantic mystery and western legend more than did Colorado's Mountain of the Holy Cross. Prior to William Henry Jackson's 1873 photo (created during a government expedition led by Ferdinand Vandeveer Hayden), the mountain was known primarily through folklore that traced its first sightings to Spanish explorers. Popularly believed to have been emblazoned on the mountain by the hand of God, the cross came to be seen as a call for Americans to renew the Christian morality required to settle the West. Mountain of the Holy Cross was thus seen as a New-World embodiment of the Old Testament site where God was revealed to Moses, and was quickly deemed an ""American Sinai."" The mountain's role as an emblem of the religious call to Western settlement was enhanced by its position between the crucial 39<sup>th</sup> and 40<sup>th</sup> degrees of latitude, a location that Hayden had called public attention to in his annual report to Congress in 1873. Surrounded by mountains and linked with a river system, many saw Colorado Territory (which became a state within a year of Moran's painting) as the spiritual heart of the budding American Empire. 

Upon seeing Jackson's photo, Moran traveled to the area the following summer, where he decided to use the waterfall in the foreground to emphasize the monumentality of the scene and bring it more in line with popular conventions regarding the picturesque. With this characteristic use of artistic license, Moran completed the painting in April of 1874 from his Newark studio, and by early June arranged for the picture to go on display at the Corcoran Gallery in Washington. 

Perhaps due to its overtly religious message, <em>Mountain of the Holy Cross</em> remained unsold for several years, until it was purchased in 1880 by Dr. William Bell, a founding member of the Denver and Rio Grande Railroad consortium. Moran was market-savvy, and knew when he painted <em>Mountain of the Holy Cross</em> that the natural formation would be interpreted as divine favor for western expansion, a central tenet of European-American social and religious thought. Under his ownership, Bell took this symbolism one step further by selling tickets to see the painting to pilgrims visiting his home on their way to the mineral springs of the Rockies."
91.228.2,"Painting by William Henry Dethlef Koerner, <em>Tall in the Saddle</em>, 1900-1934.
Reproduced in <em>The Sturday Evening Post</em> on June 2, 1934."
92.6.1,"Painting by Richard Brydges Beechey, <em>The Mission of San Carlos, Monterey</em>, 1827.

British Navy officer Richard Beechey sketched the Mission of San Carlos (Carmel) while stationed in California. Just left of center, Beechey depicted a group of Native Americans."
92.126.1,"Painting by John Gast, <em>American Progress</em>, 1872.
Publisher George Crofutt worked with illustrator John Gast to create <em>American Progress</em>, which he distributed as a print with his magazine, <em>Crofutt&rsquo;s Western World</em>. With so many images of the western landscape already in circulation, Crofutt decided to create a new design. He discussed his ideas with Gast, and together they came up with this image, which Crofutt described as a: 
<em>... beautiful and charming female ... floating westward through the air, bearing on her forehead the ""Star of Empire"" . . . In her right hand she carries a book ... the emblem of education and ... national enlightenment, while with the left hand she unfolds and stretches the slender wires of the telegraph, that are to flash intelligence throughout the land.</em>"
92.147.1,"Painting by Andrew Melrose, <em>Westward the Star of Empire Takes Its Way - Near Council Bluffs, Iowa</em>, 1867.
 Signed bottom right.

European-Americans of the late nineteenth century saw themselves as living in a fundamentally transformative time; change was a major theme of art that depicted frontier settlement as a process of nation building. Progress entailed loss as well as gain, shown here by tree stumps where the wilderness once stood. Melrose painted this picture in celebration of the railroad’s arrival in Council Bluffs, suggesting this was a small price to pay for the coming of civilization. 

In Andrew Melrose’s painting, the wilderness on the right side of the image is transformed into a pioneer homestead, as the darkness gives way to the rosy dawn of a new day. Fueling this process is the engine, its headlamp burning bright as it leads the way for future settlers."
92.178.1,"Bulto by Horacio Valdez of San Miguel and the Dragon, 1992. 
Inscribed on bottom: <em>San Miguel / Archangel / Por (92) / Horacio Valdez.</em>"
92.192.1,"Sculpture by Jose Benjamin Lopez of <em>Crucifix (Cristo)</em>, a cross with the <em>corpus</em>, circa 1980.

Lopez’s monumental <em>Cristo</em> uses the natural twists and knots of the wood. Prior to its acquisition by the Autry, it was displayed in the artist’s front yard; he applied the paint, which is now flaking, to protect it from the elements. The combination of the gnarled wood and the flaking paint connect this piece to the conditions of its production, while the gaping wounds and gushing blood of Christ’s body allude to the visceral experience of the Passion, an important Catholic ritual within many Hispanic communities."
92.197.1,"Lithograph print, <em>Custer's Last Charge</em>, published by Currier and Ives, New York, 1876."
92.217.5,"Lithograph print by George H. Baker, <em>The Port of San Francisco June 1<sup>st</sup> 1849</em>, circa 1849."
93.99.4,"Drawing by Rudolf Cronau, <em>Street Scene in the Chinese Section of San Francisco.</em>, 1882.

93.120.1,"Painting by John Murdock, <em>The Escape of Kit Carson</em>, 1853.  
An illiterate apprentice, Christopher Carson ran away from Missouri at age fourteen to join the trappers of the Far West. His exploits as a scout for John Frémont and during the U.S.-Mexican War made him famous. By the 1850s dime novels, popular prints, and paintings celebrated Carson as a hero of American westward expansion. During the Civil War Carson would become the symbol for ruthless American conquest in the Southwest.

The 1840s and '50s saw a transformation of the Western trapper into a national icon, independent and resourceful.  Actual mountain men, like Kit Carson, acted out a story of the fur trade as an adventure for young, single men. Eastern audiences responded with enthusiasm."
93.131.1,"Sioux woman's dress, made by Susie Smoke, buckskin decorated with multicolored glass beads, circa 1920-1950s. 

Beaded figures of Indian riders on horseback adorn the yolk of this buckskin dress made by Susie Smoke, an Oglala Sioux woman from Pine Ridge, South Dakota. Along with the Crow and other tribes of the Great Plains, the Sioux were known for their distinctive beadwork. Clothing designs were often autobiographical, reflecting and spoke to key events in a person’s life. 

Buckskin dresses were an integral part of Native American culture. Dresses were made for a girl by her mother or grandmother at key points in her life, and marketing her journey to adulthood. As such, these dresses spoke to family history as well as individual identity. The figures on this dress testify to the symbolic power of horses in Native society. They are believed to represent deceased members of Susie Smoke’s family."
93.150.1,"Cheyenne ledger drawing, <em>Cheyenne bride and groom</em>, late 1800s."
93.173.1,"Painting by Charles Deas, <em>A Solitary Indian, Seated on the Edge of a Bold Precipice</em>, 1847. 
Signed.

In 1841, Charles Deas moved from New York City to St. Louis, then a remote  border town, where he established himself as a painter of Western life. Although he knew mountain men and Native people firsthand, he tended to focus on their appeal as “types,” or frontier characters, distinguished by their exotic appearance and surroundings. 

The figure in <em>A Solitary Indian, Seated on the Edge of a Bold Precipice</em> represents not a specific individual but a metaphor for what Deas—like many of his countrymen at mid-century—saw as the impending fate of Native America. Notice that one moccasin has slipped off into the chasm below. The implication is that the rest of him will soon follow."
93.177.5,"Etching print by Carl Christian Anton Christensen, <em>The Angel Moroni Delivering the Plate of the Book of Mormon to Joseph Smith</em>, September 22<sub>nd</sub>, 1827."

93.225.27,"Crow woman's saddle, centerfire rigged, wood and elk-horn frame covered with hide and decorated with beadwork, acquired by the Museum 1993.

To the tribes of the Great Plains, horses represented both wealth and freedom, and elaborately decorated riding gear was a critical means of cultural expression. Women's saddles were constructed differently from men's, with a wooden framework and high pommels covered in rawhide. The shape of the pommel and wide stirrups were of Spanish origin, but in Crow hands they became a space for eye-catching beadwork that moved with the horse, helping the rider to look her best."

As Americans took to travel in the years following World War II, this 1948 Indian Chief Roadmaster was designed as a handsome, comfortable rival to Harley-Davidson&rsquo;s heavyweight touring bikes. Indian&rsquo;s top, most adorned model, the Chief Roadmaster exuded power and style. Note the Indian bust on the front fender as well as the custom-fringed leatherwork."

99.1.1,"Painting by August Schoefft, <em>Six Kickapoo Indians, Chief and Family</em>, circa 1865. 
This painting memorializes an 1865 delegation of Kickapoo petitioning Emperor Maximilian for land grants in Mexico. The artist omitted from the painting two members of Papequah’s delegation who were African American moscagos, or escaped slaves.

Originally from southern Wisconsin, the Kickapoo had first moved to Illinois and later sided with the pan-Indian resistance under Tecumseh. An 1819 treaty moved them to a reservation in Missouri. They resisted again in 1832 during the Black Hawk War and when defeated were moved to a reservation in Kansas. Bands left for Texas and Coahuila, Mexico in the 1850s."
99.6.1,"California-style saddle, center-fire rigged, with mochila and anquerita, circa 1855.

Saddles were introduced to North America by the Spanish in the sixteenth century and soon became an indispensable tool of Western life. Centerfire rigging refers to the cinch that is located halfway between the cantle (the projecting piece at the back) and the fork (the piece in front where the parts of the saddle are joined). Although rarely seen on Western saddles today, this type was popular during the 1800s. 

Saddles were also an expensive commodity, and finely decorated examples spoke to the owner’s prestige. The large, square skirt on this saddle <em>mochila</em>, derived from Spanish styles, is covered in an elaborate design of vaqueros roping a bear, by Charles Christian Nahl."

Boxes of all sizes were a basic household item in Haida and Tlingit societies, where they served as furniture and storage for everything from food to the community's most precious ceremonial regalia. Shaped from a single plank of cedar that was steamed and bent, these boxes have no seams and are elaborately decorated with the family’s crest, which protects their contents."
491.G.955,"San Ildefonso Pueblo (Tewa) jar, made by Maria Martinez, hand-formed polychrome earthenware, acquired by the Museum 1938.

The jar was signed by famed San Ildefonso potter Maria Martinez during her visit to the Southwest Museum in 1975. Martinez was trained by her aunt in the traditional pottery methods, although she often hid her early creations away, convinced that their quality was not up to ancient standards. In 1909, she joined forces with Museum of New Mexico founder Edgar Lee Hewitt to create works for the museum. This encouragement launched her long career, during which she constantly experimented with new methods of firing and glazing."
491.G.1468AABB,"Sioux possible bag, a pair, beaded buckskin, beaded buckskin, 1920s.
Some Native tribes called this bag by a name which in translation means <em>bag-for-every-possible-thing</em>. The European trappers shortened the term to <em>possible sacks</em>, hence the name ""possible bags""."
491.G.2137,"Santa Clara Pueblo (Tewa) jar, blackware, circa 1914.

North of Santa Fe, the Santa Clara Pueblo is famous for its blackware pottery such as this piece, which features a sparse design of bear paw impressions on the surface. The distinctive color is a result of being fired in special outdoor pits, in which the iron in the local clay oxidizes, turning the pot a deep, rich black."
496.G.57,"Painting by Alonso Cano, <em>Martyrdom of St. Sebastian</em>, Spain, early to mid-1600s. Restored in 1982 by  Carlos Osona from the Santa Barbara Arts Conservation Center.

Imported from Spain, images of saints became the basis of a new iconography that adorned both churches and private homes. The story of Saint Sebastian—who was tied to a stake and shot full of arrows for converting people to Christianity in ancient Rome—provided an example of devotion and suffering for the faithful. Alonso Cano was the ""most celebrated draughtsman among all Spanish painters"" who worked in seventeenth-century Spain. This painting formerly hung in the Southwest Museum’s Casa de Adobe—a re-creation of a nineteenth-century Californio home that opened as a tourist attraction in Los Angeles in 1916. The use of a Spanish religious painting in a historic setting was meant to evoke the cultural patrimony of California’s Spanish descendants."
535.G.489,"Navajo (Dine) third-phase chief-style blanket (beeldlei or hanolchadi), 1865-1875.
The terraced motifs in this design layout found their way into the longer-than-wide chief-styles from designs used by early Navajo weavers in their biils and early basket patterns.  These terraced diamond and triangle motifs in the zoned layout became known as the ""third-phase chief-style."""
535.G.627,"Navajo (Dine) blanket, first phase chief-style (beeldlei or hanolchadi), 1880-1910.
Wider-than-long banded blankets of this type are rare and are documented from Southwest archaeological sites dating to at least 1750. While the shape is derived from the Pueblo manta-style garment, the pattern is believed to be one of the oldest in the Navajo design repertoire and probably predates 1750, although no earlier examples are documented. The Navajo term <em>hanolchadi</em>, or carded wool, was recorded in 1910 by Father Bernard Haile to connote the chief-style blanket, which was commercially sold under this term by trader Juan Lorenzo Hubbell. The attribution of ""chief"" is a misnomer and has nothing to do with Navajo social structure. The blankets were thus named because the style was prized by Plains Indian leaders, or chiefs, who historically acquired them for their wives and daughters as status symbols."
609.G.717,"Painting by Maynard Dixon, <em>Iesaka Waken</em>, 1922.

The model for the figure was a Winnebago Indian named George Whitewing, an extra for early Hollywood Western films, and who Dixon used for as a model for murals painted for Anita Baldwin McClaughry in 1912. Whitewing and Dixon became close friends."
630.G.38,"Navajo (Dine) chief-style variant blanket (beeldlei or hanolchadi), 1885-1900.
Crosses serve as replacements for the diamonds in this chief-style variant.  Crosses are documented in weaving designs by 1862, but the Navajo are known to have painted crosses on hides as early as 1705.  It is thought that by the 1700s, in addition to associating the cross as a symbol of peace, the Navajo associated it with a European-American Christian ethic.  Prior to this, celestial stars in Navajo eschatology were represented by cross shapes."
653.G.1,"Painting by Silverhorn (Kiowa), <em>Battle of the Washita</em>, 1890.
On November 27, 1868 George Armstrong Custer attacked the village of Cheyenne chief Black Kettle on the Washita River. Black Kettle, a peace advocate who had survived the Sand Creek Massacre, and his wife Medicine Women were killed as they tried to flee. Custer took fifty-three women and children captive to serve as hostages and human shields."
757.G.1,"Haida house post, one of a pair, carved and painted wood, Prince of Wales Island, Alaska, circa 1860.

This pair of house posts was originally in the house of a Haida chief on Prince of Wales Island in southeastern Alaska. They were removed in 1906 and brought to Los Angeles as part of an “Indian Village” exhibit in present-day Lincoln Park. 

House posts are a type of totem pole, an elaborately carved, vertical sculpture consisting of symbolic representations of animals and spirit beings. House posts speak of family legends or lineage and include the crests of the owner and his wife's families. In the past, as a family grew in stature, their house posts grew in size. Typically made of cedar, house posts (like all totem poles) decay in the damp climate of the Northwest; as a result, few examples dating before 1905 exist."

Ollas—large storage pottery jars and baskets with a tall body and a narrow neck—were often traded or sold to settlers, and later tourists, beginning in the 1880s. Among the symbols used in Apache baskets are diamonds, triangles, crosses, animals, and human figures. In this example, animal and plant motifs—likely cacti and horses—represent the landscape."

A 368 degree panoramic view from top of snow covered peak of 13,061 feet (3,981 m) Mt. Dana, the second highest peak in Yosemite National Park, California. Panoramas—or wide-angle landscapes designed to encompass as much space as possible—have played a major role in shaping our perception of the West as a vast, monumental landscape. Foster uses a special camera with a rotating lens to create images that sometimes exceed 360 degrees, more than what can be seen by the human eye."

2004.23.2,"Painting by Harold Gregor, <em>Illinois Flatscape no. 61</em>, 1997. 

In his paintings, Gregor uses an aerial perspective to represent a Midwestern farm, a landscape known as ""America’s breadbasket"" because of its rich soil and agricultural surplus. This region extends from Michigan south to Kansas, northern Oklahoma, and Texas, and accounts for the majority of America’s grain production. Bisected with irrigation ditches into geometric fields, the abstract grid of the landscape looks from above like a work of modern art."
2004.25.1,"Sculpture by Luis Tapia, <em>Mi Carrito</em>, 1994.
 Made in the style and material typical of New Mexican carvings of saints and other Roman Catholic holy figures, commonly called <em>bultos</em>.

In Hispanic and Chicano culture, customized cars called ""lowriders"" have special meaning. Designed to cruise low and slow, lowriders sport spectacular paint jobs and handcrafted interiors. Luis Tapia’s <em>Mi Carrito</em> exudes the blend of popular and religious imagery that is at the heart of contemporary Hispanic art, as well as the individualized nature of both lowriders and <em>santos</em> as art forms. Emblazoned on the grill and steering wheel is a sacred heart, a symbol of the physical heart of Christ and his love, compassion, and suffering. Other symbols include the priest's chairs for bucket seats and the vigas, or traditional beams used in adobe architecture, for bumpers."

Influenced by the Navajo emphasis on harmony with nature, Whitehorse explores her native landscape through abstract marks that represent symbols, plants, and events to create a mental experience of land. This emphasis on the relationship between the artist and the land speaks to the intimate familiarity that many Native peoples have felt about their environment. As Whitehorse observed: <em>My paintings tell the story of knowing land over time—of being completely, micro-cosmically within a place . . . they are purposefully meditative and meant to be seen slowly. Their intricate language of symbols refers to specific plants, people, and experiences.</em>"

2007.89.1,"Video by Kristina Faragher, <em>Gaping Mouth</em>, 2006. 

Shot in Yosemite in 2006, Kristina Faragher's video is a study in contrasting views. At times, the camera is pointed up high at distant sites; at others, it looks directly at the ground, capturing leaves, twigs, and the artist’s feet. Reflections, rushing water, and constructed elements all combine to create an impressionistic and experiential landscape that captures her individual experience of Yosemite while referencing its famous features. The title of the work refers to the name first applied to the now-famous valley by its original residents. The Southern Miwok called the valley <em>awahni</em>, or ""place like a gaping mouth."""

At the center of the design of Preston Singletary's <em>Sun Box</em> is Raven, who is the primary ancestor of his family's clan.

The title <em>Balance of Power</em> refers to the relationship between the human and animal worlds that these rattles were designed to evoke."

Fascinated by the ritual dramas and spiritual life of Native and Hispanic culture since childhood, Paul Pletka's work exudes the dynamic tension that can occur when state-sponsored religion is imposed upon Indigenous peoples. This is the case with <em>Tears of the Lord</em>, in which the figure of Christ, his flesh wooden and peeling as if a devotional sculpture, is shown nailed to an Aztec cross. At his feet a group of Mexican people wear a combination of traditional and contemporary dress, which in turn reflects both Indigenous and Western designs. Their disregard for the image of suffering taking place in their midst suggests the ambivalence that European beliefs are sometimes met with in Native societies."

Three years later he reworked the composition, extending the cowboy’s right arm as and titling his upper body forward as you see in this version, creating a more violent sense of movement."

These figures, called santos (religious carvings depicting saints) or bultos (saints carved in the round), often feature solid bases and elongated forms so they can be raised and seen from high. Some of the earliest santos appear to be in the style of the Spanish baroque. In modern practice, santos are a sophisticated and vibrant art form."
